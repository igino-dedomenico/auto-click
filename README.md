# Prevent Standby Script

## Introduction
This Python script is designed to prevent your computer from going into standby mode by simulating key presses at regular intervals. This can be useful in situations where you need your computer to remain awake for a prolonged period of time, such as when running long-running tasks or processes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pyautogui library

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install the pyautogui library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install pyautogui`

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command: python auto-clicker.py <idle_time_seconds>

Replace `<idle_time_seconds>` with the desired idle time in seconds before a key press is simulated. For example, to prevent standby for 5 minutes (300 seconds), you would run:

`python auto-clicker.py 300`

4. The script will start running and simulate key presses at regular intervals to prevent your computer from going into standby mode. You can stop the script manually when you no longer need to prevent standby.

## Notes
- Ensure that your system allows Python scripts to simulate key presses, as some operating systems or security settings may restrict this functionality.
- Use this script responsibly and only for its intended purpose.
